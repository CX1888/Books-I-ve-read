# Books-I-ve-read
This repository is a personal knowledge base where I document the books I’ve read and the insights I've gained from them, particularly in the areas of product creation and starting a business. 
It begins with biographies of entrepreneurs and books on startups. 
Along the way, I’ll also document my own journey of building a company from the ground up (from 0 to 1).
